This may seem fine and might actually be the only way you would think about this if not for the Octopus merge.
You have three merge commits here and as we know merge commits are noise.
 They pollute the history of your repository and interrupt the story told by your Git history.
  So, how about keeping the noise low by just having one Merge commit instead of three. How you ask?
  Octopus, My friend. All hail the great and mighty Octopus.
   So, the way you perform an Octopus is by merging all the branches at once on to the master. To do that you give a command like this

Git merge octopus

This will merge all the three branches to master.
The branches will look something like this. Do you see the reference of Octopus now?

command: git merge branch1  development
